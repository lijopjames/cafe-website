## About this Project

This project is a Cafe - Table Reservation system I have created as part of my "Web Application Development" module  at Waikato Institute of Technology. (Graduate Diploma in Applied Information Technology, 2019 - 2020)

I have used the most popular PHP framework - **Laravel** to build it along with **MySQL** as the database.

Like every other complete web application, it has two different components:

The **client-side application** which can be accessible to anyone can be used for table reservation, look up and filter the menu, contact the cafe team and even to know the cafe location.

The **server-side application** which can be accessible to the cafe team is used to confirm the table reservations, add a new delicacy to the menu and to read from the contact-form.

I have used two different free to use website themes to configure the website in Laravel PHP.
